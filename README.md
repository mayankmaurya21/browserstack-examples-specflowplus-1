## Introduction

SpecFlow is the #1 .NET open source framework for Behavior Driven Development, Acceptance Test Driven Development and Specification by Example. With over 10m downloads on NuGet, SpecFlow is trusted by teams around the world.

This BrowserStack Example repository demonstrates a #{ Selenium test / Cypress / Puppeteer / Other } framework written in Cucumber and Junit 5 with parallel testing capabilities. The #{ Selenium test / Cypress / Puppeteer / Other } test scripts are written for the open source [BrowserStack Demo web application](https://bstackdemo.com) ([Github](https://github.com/browserstack/browserstack-demo-app)). This BrowserStack Demo App is an e-commerce web application which showcases multiple real-world user scenarios. The app is bundled with offers data, orders data and products data that contains everything you need to start using the app and run tests out-of-the-box.

The #{ Selenium test / Cypress / Puppeteer / Other } tests are run on different platforms like on-prem, docker and BrowserStack using various run configurations and test capabilities.

## Test infrastructure environments 

- [ON_PREM](#on-premise-self-hosted)
- [DOCKER](#docker)
- [default or null](#browserstack)

---

# On Premise / Self Hosted

This infrastructure points to running the tests on your own machine using a browser (e.g. Chrome) using the browser's driver executables (e.g. ChromeDriver for Chrome). #{ Selenium enables this functionality using WebDriver for many popular browsers.}

## Prerequisites

- For this infrastructure configuration (i.e on-premise), ensure that the ChromeDriver executable is placed in the ` SpecflowBrowserStack/Drivers/OnPremDriver/ ` folder.
- ChromeDriver can be downloaded from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

Note: The ChromeDriver version must match the Chrome browser version on your machine.

## Running Your Tests

### Run a specific test on your own machine

- How to run the test?

  To run the default test scenario (e.g. Login Scenario) on your own machine, use the following command:
  
  .Net Core:
    ```
  set TEST_INFRA=ON_PREM
  dotnet test --filter "TestCategory=Single"
  ```

  To run a specific test scenario use the filter tagged to that feature file.
  
  .Net Core:
  ```
  dotnet test --filter "TestCategory=<Tag>"
  ```

  where,  the argument 'Tag' can be any profile configured with filters in feature files for this repository.
  
  E.g. "Single", "Local".

- Output

  This run profile executes a specific test scenario on a single browser instance on your own machine.


- Output

  This run profile executes the test Feature file sequentially on a single browser, on your own machine.

## Running Your Tests

### Run a specific test on the docker infrastructure

- How to run the test?

    - Start the Docker by running the following command:

  ```
  docker-compose up -d
  ```

   To run the default test scenario (e.g. Login Scenario) on your own machine, use the following command:
  
  .Net Core:
    ```
  set TEST_INFRA=DOCKER
  dotnet test --filter "TestCategory=Single"
  ```

  To run a specific test scenario use the filter tagged to that feature file.
  
  .Net Core:
  ```
  dotnet test --filter "TestCategory=<Tag>"
  ```

  where, the argument 'Tag' can be any profile configured with filters in feature files for this repository.
  
  E.g. "Single", "Local".

- Output

  This run profile executes a specific test scenario on a single browser instance on your own machine.


- Output

  This run profile executes the test Feature file sequentially on a single browser, on your own machine.

  - After tests are complete, you can stop the Docker by running the following command:
      
  ```
  docker-compose down
  ```

- Output

  This run profile executes a specific test scenario on a single browser deployed on a docker image.

## Test Reporting

-SpecFlow can generates reports once your tests have finished executing that include a breakdown of the results of your tests. The default report includes a statistical overview of the status of all tests, as well as information on individual scenarios, including Gherkin test cases, statistics on the total number and percentage of successful tests, and the execution time for each step. When running tests from within Visual Studio, a link to the generated report(s) is included in the Output window once the tests have completed.
 [Report](https://docs.specflow.org/projects/specflow-runner/en/latest/Usage/Reports.html)
 
**Note** -If you are running your tests on Linux or macOS, you need [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/) installed in order to generate reports with SpecFlow+.             Make sure you have installed Mono on the machine you are using to execute your tests (i.e. on your development machine or build server). We have tests             for the reports using the latest version of Mono, but previous versions should also work.

          For more information on installing Mono, please refer to the Mono documentation:
